# Masterpiece Market — Official Rules

## Welcome

You are an art collector navigating a living, competitive market. Acquire masterworks at auction, manage your collection's costs, cultivate relationships with curators, and outwit rival collectors — all in pursuit of the most prestigious portfolio in the game.

## Object of the Game

Build the most prestigious art collection while maintaining financial solvency. Prestige is measured by:

- **Net Worth** — The combined value of your credits and collection.
- **Stewardship Score** — How actively you manage your artworks (loans, exhibitions, provenance care).
- **Curator Relationships** — The depth of your partnerships with in-game curators.
- **Progression Tier** — Your rank among collectors (Beginner, Mid-Tier, Whale).

## Setup / Getting Started

- Each new player starts with **10,000 credits**.
- All players begin at the **Beginner** tier.
- The art market is **persistent and shared** across all players — artworks bought, sold, and loaned exist in a single living economy.

## Game Concepts

### Credits

Credits are the currency of Masterpiece Market.

- **Earned by:** selling artworks at auction, collecting loan fees from curators, completing dealer deals.
- **Spent on:** auction bids, weekly carry costs (insurance premiums + storage fees).

Guard your credit balance carefully. Running out has consequences (see Delinquency Rules).

### Artworks

Each artwork in the game is unique and defined by:

- **Insured Value (IV)** — Its official appraised worth.
- **Tier** — A quality classification (A, B, C, or D).
- **Provenance History** — A permanent, visible record of every owner and major event.

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **A** | Iconic masterpiece |
| **B** | Major work |
| **C** | Mid-tier piece |
| **D** | Edition / minor work |

### Insured Value (IV)

The Insured Value is the official appraised value of an artwork. It determines:

- Your weekly insurance premium.
- Storage fees charged against the work.
- Loan fees earned when lending to curators.

IV may be adjusted over time by market events.

## How to Play

### Attending Auctions

1. Browse upcoming auctions in the **Auction House**.
2. Join a live auction room when the auction starts.
3. Place bids above the current highest bid (a minimum increment applies).
4. Auctions have a **countdown timer**. Late bids placed in the final seconds extend the timer by **15 seconds**.
5. The **highest bidder** when the timer expires wins the lot.
6. The winner's credits are debited immediately and artwork ownership transfers on the spot.
7. A **provenance event** is recorded on the artwork's history.

> **Example:** The auction for "Starry Night" (IV: 600,000) opens at 300,000. You bid 310,000. Another player bids 320,000. You bid 350,000 with 5 seconds left — the timer extends by 15 seconds. No further bids arrive. You win at 350,000 credits.

### Paying Weekly Costs

Every week (game time), each artwork you own generates a bill.

**Weekly Cost = (IV × premium_rate) + storage_fee**

| Tier | Premium Rate (per week) | Storage Fee (per week) |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|
| A (Iconic) | 0.60% of IV | 200 credits |
| B (Major) | 0.35% of IV | 80 credits |
| C (Mid) | 0.20% of IV | 25 credits |
| D (Edition) | 0.08% of IV | 5 credits |

Bills are **automatically deducted** from your credit balance each week.

> **Example:** You own "Mona Lisa" (Tier A, IV: 1,000,000).
> Weekly cost = (1,000,000 × 0.006) + 200 = 6,000 + 200 = **6,200 credits/week**.

---

### Idle Surcharge

If you take **no qualifying action** (loan, list for sale, exhibit) with an artwork for **8 consecutive weeks**, its insurance premium increases by **20%**.

- Any qualifying activity resets the idle counter to zero.
- The surcharge does not stack — capped at +20%.

> **Example:** Your Tier B artwork normally costs 0.35%/wk in premium. After 8 idle weeks, the premium rises to 0.35% × 1.20 = **0.42%/wk** until you take action with that piece.

---

### Loaning to Curators

Curators are in-game characters who request to borrow artworks for **2-week exhibitions**.

**Benefits of loaning:**

- Your insurance premium on the loaned work is **reduced by 70%** (you pay only 30% of the normal premium) for the duration of the loan.
- The curator pays you a **loan fee** based on their tier.
- Loans count as activity and **reset the idle counter**.

| Curator Tier | Loan Fee (% of IV per 2-week exhibition) |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Assistant (Tier 1) | 0.25% |
| Curator (Tier 2) | 0.45% |
| Chief (Tier 3) | 0.75% |
| Legendary | 1.20% |

Higher-tier curators are **pickier** about which works they will accept. Building relationships over time unlocks access to the most prestigious exhibitions.

> **Example:** You loan "Starry Night" (IV: 600,000) to Dr. Celeste Armand (Curator tier).
> - Loan fee earned: 600,000 × 0.0045 = **2,700 credits**.
> - During the 2-week loan, your weekly premium drops from 0.35% to 0.105% (30% of 0.35%).

### Delinquency Rules

If your credits cannot cover your weekly bill:

1. You enter a **72-hour grace period**.
2. During the grace period, sell artworks, arrange loans, or otherwise raise credits.
3. After 72 hours unpaid, a **forced auction** begins:
   - The system selects your **lowest-tier works first** for consignment.
   - Selected works are automatically placed into auction.
   - Auction proceeds cover your debt **first**; any remainder returns to you.
4. While delinquent, you **cannot bid** in any other auctions.

> **Example:** Your weekly bill is 8,000 credits but you only have 2,000. Grace period starts. After 72 hours, your Tier D artwork (IV: 5,000) is auto-consigned and sells for 4,500. Debt remaining: 8,000 - 2,000 - 4,500 = 1,500. Another work is consigned until debt is cleared.

---

### Inactivity Rules

1. **30 days** no login/action — **Estate Notice** sent.
2. **60 days** inactive — **Estate Auction** triggered.
   - **Exception:** Credits cover **8 weeks of total carry costs** → holdings preserved.
3. Estate Auction: **entire collection** auctioned to other players.
4. Proceeds held for **90 days** for the player to claim.
5. After 90 days unclaimed, proceeds **forfeited to market pool**.
