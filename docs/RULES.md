# Masterpiece Market — Official Rules

## Welcome

You are an art collector navigating a living, competitive market. Acquire masterworks at auction, manage your collection's costs, cultivate relationships with curators, and build toward founding your own museum.

## Object of the Game

Build a collection worthy of founding a museum — or climb as high as you can through the achievement tiers. Every run ends with a result: Hall, Gallery, Wing, or Museum.

## Setup / Getting Started

- Each new player starts with **1,000,000 credits** and **one D-tier artwork**.
- All players begin at the **Emerging** tier.
- The art market is **persistent and shared** across all players.

## Game Concepts

### Credits

Credits are the only currency of Masterpiece Market.

- **Earned by:** loan fees from curators, selling artworks, genre bonuses.
- **Spent on:** auction bids, dealer purchases, mystery packages, weekly carry costs, mortgage interest.

Guard your credit balance carefully. Running out ends your run.

### Artworks

Each artwork is unique and defined by:

- **Insured Value (IV)** — Its official appraised worth.
- **Tier** — A quality classification (A, B, C, or D) derived from IV.
- **Tags** — Genre/style labels (e.g. impressionist, portrait, landscape).

| Tier | IV Range | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **A** | ≥ 350,000 cr | Iconic masterpiece |
| **B** | ≥ 75,000 cr | Major work |
| **C** | ≥ 50,000 cr | Mid-tier piece |
| **D** | < 50,000 cr | Edition / minor work |

### Expertise

Expertise measures your knowledge of and engagement with the art world. It is primarily earned through the **Daily Quiz** (1 point per correct answer, available 7 days a week). A minimum expertise of **10** is required to found a museum.

## How to Play

### 1. Browse the Catalog

The Catalog shows all works and their current owners.

### 2. Acquire Artworks

There are three ways to acquire artworks:

- **Bid in auctions** — Browse upcoming auctions, join live bidding, win lots. Late bids extend the timer by **15 seconds**.
- **Buy from dealer inventory** — Purchase available works directly at the listed price.
- **Mystery packages** — Buy for 100,000 cr, receive a random artwork (weighted: 20% D, 35% C, 35% B, 10% A).

> **Acquisition Limit:** You may acquire at most **1 artwork per week** through dealer purchases and mystery packages. Auction wins are not subject to this limit.

### 3. Hold and Manage Your Collection

Owning art costs credits every week. Maintain enough credits to cover your burn.

### 4. Loan to Curators

Loan works to curators for 4–12 week exhibitions. While on loan:
- Premium is **reduced by 70%**
- Curator pays you a **loan fee** (see table below)
- Idle counter resets

### 5. Take the Daily Quiz

Answer an art-knowledge question each day. Correct answers earn **1 expertise**. Free to take.

### 6. Sell

- **Consign to auction** — Market outcome; potentially the best price, but risky.
- **Direct sell to dealer** — Instant sale at **50% of IV**. Guaranteed liquidity.

## Ownership Costs

### Weekly Carry

Each owned work costs credits every week:

**Weekly Carry = (IV × Premium Rate) + Storage Fee**

| Tier | Premium Rate | Storage Fee | Example (IV = 100k) |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A | 1.50% / wk | 1,000 cr | — |
| B | 1.00% / wk | 500 cr | — |
| C | 0.75% / wk | 250 cr | 1,000 cr/wk |
| D | 0.50% / wk | 100 cr | — |

### Idle Surcharge

If an artwork sits idle for **8 consecutive weeks** (no loan, no sale, no exhibition), its premium increases by **20%**. Any qualifying activity resets the counter.

### Loan Premium Reduction

While on loan, the premium is reduced by **70%** (you pay only 30% of the normal rate).

---

## Curator Loan Fees

Curators pay a one-time fee when borrowing your artwork:

| Curator Tier | Loan Fee (% of IV) |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Assistant | 1.0% |
| Curator | 2.0% |
| Chief | 3.5% |
| Legendary | 5.0% |

### Genre Bonus

When you loan 2+ artworks sharing a tag in the same week, you earn a **+50% bonus** on the loan fee for each matching work. Building thematic collections is financially rewarded.

---

## Mortgage

When your runway is low, mortgage an artwork to raise cash without selling:

- **Borrow:** up to 50% of artwork IV
- **Interest:** 2% of principal per week
- **Term:** 12 weeks
- **Limit:** 2 mortgages at a time

If you can't repay at term end, the artwork is sold at dealer rate to settle the debt. Mortgaged works cannot be loaned. All mortgages must be cleared before founding a museum.

---

## Auctions

### Bidding

Auctions have a countdown timer. Late bids in the final seconds extend the timer by **15 seconds**. A **5% buyer premium** and **2.5% seller fee** apply at settlement.

### Dealer Backstop

Each lot has a backstop: **25% of IV**. If the high bid falls short or there are no bids, the dealer buys in at the backstop amount.

---

## Achievement Tiers

When your run ends, you receive the highest tier you qualify for:

| Achievement | Requirements |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Hall** | 2+ artworks, 2+ tags |
| **Gallery** | 4+ artworks, 3+ tags, 1+ B-tier |
| **Wing** | 6+ artworks, 4+ tags, 2+ B-tier, 1+ A-tier |
| **Museum** | Full founding requirements (see below) |

There is no "bankruptcy" — just "your journey ended and here's what you built."
